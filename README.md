 Student Grade Calculator
1. Objective
To create a Python program that uses classes, loops, and conditionals to calculate a student’s final grade based on marks entered in multiple subjects.
2. Detailed Description
Students must design a class named Student that stores:
Student name
List of subject marks
The program should:
Ask the user how many subjects they have
Use a loop to input marks for each subject
Calculate the average percentage
Use conditional statements to assign a grade based on the percentage (A, B, C, D, Fail)
Example Grade Logic:
Above 90 → A
75–89 → B
60–74 → C
40–59 → D
Below 40 → Fail
The program should finally display:
All subject marks
Total marks
Percentage
Final grade
